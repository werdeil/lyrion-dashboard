  Read data from Lyrion's SQLite databases — library stats, stored lyrics,
  album covers, recent plays. Use this whenever a task queries `library.db` or
  `persist.db`, adds or changes a statistic, or touches `services/database.py`.
  Covers the read-only connection model (RO open + `ATTACH persist.db`), the

# Reading Lyrion's SQLite databases

All DB access lives in `services/database.py`. These databases belong to **Lyrion**, not to this app — the app opens them **read-only** and never writes. (Web lyrics can't be persisted here for exactly this reason; they go to a cache or into file tags — see the `lyrics` skill.)

## The connection model

Use the `get_db_conn()` context manager for every query — don't open sqlite inline in a route or elsewhere:

```python
with get_db_conn() as conn:
    row = conn.execute("SELECT lyrics FROM tracks WHERE id = ?", (track_id,)).fetchone()
```

It opens `library.db` in read-only URI mode (`file:...?mode=ro`), **`ATTACH`es** `persist.db` (also RO) as the `persist` schema, sets `row_factory = sqlite3.Row` (access columns by name), applies read-tuning pragmas (mmap/cache/temp), wraps the work in `BEGIN DEFERRED` … `COMMIT`, and defines the `play_counts` TEMP view (see below). Two databases, one connection:

- **`library.db`** (default schema) — the music library: `tracks`, `albums`, `contributor_track`, `genres`, and, when the plugin is installed, the Alternative Play Count table `alternativeplaycount`.
- **`persist.db`** (referenced as `persist.<table>`) — persistent per-track state: `persist.tracks_persistent` (ratings, `lastplayed`, …).

The DB paths come from config (`DB_PATH`, `DB_PERSIST_PATH`). They are derived from `LYRION_DATA_DIR`, the directory holding Lyrion's own `prefs/` and `cache/` — `{dir}/cache/library.db` and `{dir}/prefs/persist.db` — which `DB_DIR` and `DB_PERSIST_DIR` override one at a time when either was relocated. Tests set the two overrides directly (see the `testing` skill), so they never depend on that layout.

## Key tables and columns

- `tracks` — one row per track. `id` (the Lyrion track id used everywhere, e.g. lyrics lookup), `url`, `urlmd5` (join key to the play counts), `album` (→ `albums.id`), `audio` (filter `audio = 1` for real tracks), `lyrics`, `year`, `coverid`.
- `albums` — `id`, `artwork` (the **coverid** of the album's artwork track, the same id `/cover/<coverid>.jpg` serves).
- `contributor_track` — track↔artist links with a `role`: **role 5 = ALBUMARTIST**, **role 1 = ARTIST** (track artist). "Album artists" filter `role = 5`; the `track_artists_*` stats filter `role IN (1, 5)` — the union, shown in the UI as "All artists".
- `persist.tracks_persistent` — `rating`, `playcount`, `lastplayed` (unix seconds; **bumped on skips too**). Lyrion's own counters, and the fallback source of `play_counts`.

## Play counts: `play_counts`, not the plugin table

Real listening data comes from the [Alternative Play Count](https://github.com/AF-1/lms-alternativeplaycount) plugin's `alternativeplaycount` table, which keeps **plays separate from skips**:

- `playcount` / `lastplayed` — genuine plays. "Played" means `playcount > 0`.
- `skipcount` / `lastskipped` — skips.

The plugin is **recommended, not required**, so no query names that table. `get_db_conn` defines a TEMP view **`play_counts`** (`urlmd5`, `playcount`, `skipcount`, `lastplayed`) over whichever source `_use_apc` picks — the plugin's table, else `persist.tracks_persistent` with `skipcount` forced to 0 — and every query joins the view, aliased `apc`. `PLAY_COUNTS_SOURCE=lyrion` forces the fallback even when the plugin is installed, for a library whose history predates it. A TEMP view is writable on a read-only connection: it lives in the connection's temp schema, never in Lyrion's files. Use the view for anything about what was played; add a column to both definitions rather than referencing a source table directly.

On the fallback two things degrade, and the code says so where it matters: skips do not exist at all, and `lastplayed` is bumped on a skip too, so `get_recent_album_covers` can surface an album that was only skipped past. `_compute_stats` reports which source it used as **`apc_available`** — the plugin's table *and* not overridden — and the template drops the "Skips" row when it is false.

## The stats cache (single-flight)

`get_stats()` returns library statistics cached for `STATS_TTL` (60s) behind `_stats_lock`. The lock makes the recompute **single-flight**: when the cache expires, simultaneous clients wait for one computation instead of each firing their own set of full-library aggregations. It returns a **copy** so callers can't mutate the cached dict. Keep both properties if you touch it — the stats are four full-library scans and the page polls them from every open client.

`_compute_stats()` runs **four queries** (albums+songs, album artists, track artists, misc) using CTEs to scan `tracks JOIN play_counts` once each, then derives percentages via the local `pct()` helper. Every count coalesces to 0 (`row[...] or 0`) so an empty library yields zeros, not `None`.

## Adding or changing a statistic

1. Add the aggregation to the right query in `_compute_stats` (reuse the `track_play` CTE pattern; scan once, don't add a query per number).
2. Add the key to the `stats` dict (coalesce to `0`); add a `_pct` via `pct()` if it's a proportion.
3. Surface it: the `/stats.json` route returns the whole dict, and the template renders named fields — a new stat shown on the page needs an `i18n.py` label (both `fr` and `en`) and a mention in `docs/endpoints.md` or `docs/configuration.md` if it's part of the documented surface (see the `i18n` and `add-route` skills).
4. Test it: build a small temp SQLite DB with the tables/rows you need and assert the computed number, with and without `alternativeplaycount` if the number depends on play counts (see `tests/test_get_recent_album_covers.py`, `tests/test_without_alternativeplaycount.py`, `tests/test_stats_cache.py`). Don't hit a real Lyrion DB. See the `testing` skill.

## Rules

- **Read-only, always.** No `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`; the app must never write to Lyrion's databases. The one `CREATE` is the `play_counts` TEMP view, which lands in the connection's temp schema.
- Always go through `get_db_conn()`; parameterize queries (`?` placeholders), never string-format user input into SQL.
- Filter real tracks with `audio = 1`; join play data via `urlmd5`.
- Join `play_counts` (never `alternativeplaycount` directly) when you mean "actually played".
