  Work on the dashboard's frontend — the vanilla JS/CSS page with no framework
  or bundler. Use this whenever a task touches `static/nowplaying.js`,
  `static/style.css`, the Jinja templates (`templates/nowplaying.html`,
  `_icons.html`), the accent-color tinting, the karaoke lyrics sync, the
  now-playing poll, or the empty-state mosaic / recent-plays pile. Covers how
  the page is wired, how it reads i18n and data from the server, the ESLint
  gate, and the Android bridge, so changes match the existing patterns.

# Frontend (vanilla JS/CSS, no framework)

The page is plain ES5-ish JavaScript and hand-written CSS — **no framework, no bundler, no build step, no npm dependencies**. Two vendored libraries in `static/lib/` (`fast-average-color`, `vibrant`) are loaded via `<script>` tags. Keep it that way: don't introduce a framework, a bundler, or a package.json.

- `static/nowplaying.js` — all page behaviour (~1300 lines, one file).
- `static/style.css` — all styling.
- `templates/nowplaying.html` — the Jinja page. `templates/_icons.html` — reusable inline-SVG icon macros (`{% import "_icons.html" as icons %}`).
- `DEV=1 python app.py` live-reloads templates and disables static caching, so HTML/CSS/JS edits show on a plain refresh (see `config.py`).

The control that resumes the karaoke follow wears `lyrics_sync_icon`, freed when the auto-search switch went: a circular-arrow glyph there read as a second refresh button next to the real one.

Every icon on the page is an inline SVG macro from `_icons.html`, drawn in the same language: a 24px viewBox, `fill: none`, a 2px `currentColor` stroke with round caps, shared by the private `_frame` macro, and a pixel size passed by the caller. Icons are never emoji or characters from an icon font — a Raspberry Pi kiosk running Raspberry Pi OS has no emoji font installed and renders them as tofu boxes.

## Lint gate

ESLint (flat config `eslint.config.mjs`, dependency-free) runs in CI on `static/*.js` (`.github/workflows/web-ci.yml`):

```bash
npx --yes eslint@9 static/*.js
```

Match the existing style: `var`, small named `function`s, `try/catch` around `localStorage`, defensive null checks (`if (!el.retry) { return; }`).

## How the page gets its data

Nothing is hardcoded in the JS that the server already knows:

- **i18n** — the template serializes the chosen-language dict into a `<script id="i18n-data" type="application/json">` block; the JS reads it once as `I18N` and uses `I18N.some_key` for every dynamic string. Never hardcode a display string in JS — add a key in `i18n.py` (both `fr` and `en`) and read it from `I18N`. See the `i18n` skill.
- **Server host** — `document.body.dataset.lyrionHost` (`LYRION_HOST`).
- **Live state** — the JSON endpoints: `/now-playing.json` (polled), `/stats.json`, `/lyrics.json`, `/mosaic-covers.json`, `/recent-covers.json`.
- **DOM handles** — collected once into the `el = { ... }` object by id; reuse those, don't re-query.

## The polling loop

`poll()` fetches `/now-playing.json` every `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` (2000ms) and calls `render(data)`. Two efficiency contracts to preserve when editing:

- The page sends `?known=<track key>` (the `id|title|artist|album` it already shows); the server omits `lyrics` when it matches, so a steady-state poll skips the DB. Keep the key format in sync with the route.
- `?player=<id>` pins the switcher's pick (persisted in `localStorage`); a malformed id is dropped server-side.

`catchUp()` re-syncs after the tab was backgrounded. Stats poll separately (`pollStats`).

`paintProgress` runs on its own 250ms interval, extrapolating the position between network polls (and driving `syncLyrics` while there are lyrics). Both progress bars are animated with `transform: scaleX()`, never `width`: a `width` transition invalidates layout and paint on every frame of its 0.4s run, so the tick repainted the card continuously; scaleX is compositor-only and costs nothing.

## Accent color from the cover

The signature visual: the page samples the cover art (served **same-origin** via `/cover/...` precisely so the canvas isn't tainted) to derive two colors — a **tint** (the average color, `FastAverageColor`) and an **accent** (the dominant vibrant swatch, `Vibrant`, normalized in HSV via `rgb2Hsv`/`hsv2Rgb`: fixed brightness `ACCENT_V`, saturation clamped into `[ACCENT_SAT_FLOOR, ACCENT_SAT_MAX]`, and swatches under `ACCENT_SAT_MIN` — greyscale covers — falling back to `ACCENT_DEFAULT`). `SWATCH_ORDER` sets swatch preference. Vibrant reads its input at its layout size (`width`/`height`, not the natural size) and samples one pixel in five, so it is never handed the `<img>` itself — the same cover would yield a different accent on every screen size. It reads a canvas copy at `COVER_SIZE` (`swatchSource`), the size library covers are fetched at (`?size=`): those are read pixel for pixel, oversized remote artwork is scaled down. `setTint`/`setAccent`/`resetColors` push them into CSS custom properties. If you change how covers are served, keep them same-origin or the tint breaks.

The `body.in-app` header is the one place held out of that tinting: `.lyrion-link` fills the two round buttons with translucent white rather than the accent, so they lift whatever is behind them by a constant amount and drift with the page's own tint. Only the Android app ever shows that bar, and there it is framed by native chrome — status bar, navigation bar, the settings screen, all pinned to `colors.xml` — which cannot follow the cover, so an accent-filled button was the only thing in the frame changing hue per track. Anything visible on the web keeps the accent; the accent's other landing spots (progress, the active line, the switch when on, focus outlines, the stats figures) are unaffected.

`.now-playing` and `.stats-panel` carry no `backdrop-filter`, and should not get one back: the only thing painted behind them is the body's gradient, so blurring it is a visual no-op (flat fills differ by at most 1/255 with the blur removed), while the blur puts each on its own composited layer. That costs a Raspberry Pi its GPU compositing path — where a window covering the output is handed straight to the driver and Chromium's partial updates flash on screen — and makes the software fallback (`--disable-gpu-compositing`) too slow to scroll lyrics. The blur that does real work is `.cover-zoom-frost`, which blurs artwork rather than a gradient.

`html` declares `color-scheme: dark`. Without it the UA paints its light widgets — the page and lyrics scrollbars above all — over the dark page, which is what a Raspberry Pi kiosk shows. `scrollbar-color` tints them from `--tint-color` alongside everything else, and inherits, so the one declaration covers every scroller on the page.

## Fitting the viewport

Two regimes, split at 861px wide. Above it the page itself is the viewport (`html`/`body` at `100dvh`, `overflow: hidden`) and every overflowing region scrolls internally. Below it the page scrolls, because the stats panel wraps under the card — but the card is still fitted to the visible viewport in landscape (`.left-panel` at `100dvh` minus the body gutter), so the lyrics box and the mode row under it are never left off screen. Both work the same way: the card is a grid of `auto 1fr` rows, `.np-lyrics-block` stretches into the `1fr` one, and `.np-lyrics` takes what is left with `flex: 1 1 0` — a basis of `auto` would size it from the synced lyrics' full content height and push the row below out of view. `100dvh`, never `100vh`, which is iOS Safari's *large* viewport.

On the stacked layouts the cover is the lever on a short screen: it sets the card's first row, so the ladder shrinks it by viewport height (200px under 1081px wide, 160px under 600px tall, 100px under 500px) and the lyrics take what it gives back. Its floor is the meta beside it, ~94px — shrink past that and the row stops moving. Above 1080px wide the cover spans both rows in a column of its own and the meta sets row one, so it stays full size however short the screen.

## Karaoke lyrics sync

`parseLRC` turns timestamped LRC into `[{time, text}]`; `syncLyrics` (driven off the aged playback `time` from the poll) highlights the current line via `paintLine` and auto-scrolls, unless the user scrolled away (`setAutoFollow`, `updateScrollReset`, the resume-scroll button). Plain (un-timed) lyrics render as static text. The glide between lines is `scroll-behavior: smooth` on the box plus a transition on `.lrc-line`, both dropped under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. In synced mode the box also carries `will-change: transform`, which is what makes that glide affordable: held on its own layer it is rasterised once and the scroll moves the layer, instead of re-rasterising every line on each frame of the animation. Without it the glide costs 481ms of raster over eight scrolls under a software compositor, against 2ms with it — the difference between a Raspberry Pi that can run this page and one that cannot. The web search runs for every track and has no on-screen control: an operator who wants the app to stop calling out sets `LYRICS_PROVIDERS` to an empty value. The display still picks synced over plain on its own, but which version ends up on screen is the user's to change — see the version cycler below.

## Lyrics version cycler

`versions` holds the lyrics available for the current track in cycling order — the library's own text first when it has any, then every upload the web search returned (`webVersions` reads the response's `versions` list, falling back to its single `lyrics`/`synced` pair) — and `versionIdx` is the one on screen (`-1` when none is). Both reset on every track. The source line under the lyrics box (`#np-lyrics-source`) is the control: `updateSource()` renders it, `showVersion()` moves between entries, and a tap advances the index. `webVersionIdx()` is how the rest of the code asks whether a search already returned something, which is what lets a retry drop the previous answer instead of stacking a second copy of it.

`MAX_VERSIONS` (5) is the whole cycle's budget and mirrors the server constant of that name, since only the page knows whether a library text takes one of the places. `pushWebVersions` trims the tail to fit, which is why the server orders synced uploads before plain ones: the local text keeps its lead and the least useful web version is the one shed.

A version whose text matches one already in the cycle, to the whitespace, never joins it (`textKey`, `alreadyOffered`): a provider repeating what the tags already hold, or two uploads of one transcription, would spend a place on a second copy of the same reading. Timestamps count in that comparison, which is what keeps an upload's two forms apart. Dropping one silently would cost information, though: a cycle of one reads the same whether the web confirmed the text on screen or never found the track, so `echoed` records that a version was dropped and the chip shows a mark in the chevron's place — free, since the chevron only shows when there is something to cycle to.

The chip floats over the lyrics box's lower-**left** corner — the right edge is where a classic scrollbar puts its gutter, which Chromium on Linux reserves and Android does not, so the left side spares the page from measuring it. The box owes the chip `--source-clearance` of bottom padding — including in `lrc-mode`, which otherwise zeroes it. Without that, `scrollTop` clamps with the last line flush to the bottom edge and the chip covers the line being sung at the end of a song; the clearance is a shade wider than the chip's height plus its inset, so a full line of lyrics never rests under it.

One upload often carries both forms, and `webVersions` emits both: an LRC whose timings fit the recording badly is unreadable as karaoke, and its plain text is then the one that reads, so it stays one tap away rather than being weighed against the synced words first. Synced entries are emitted before plain ones, matching the server's order, so the cap keeps trimming the least useful end.

Two rules decide what lands on screen by itself. Synced lyrics take it, since the library's own text is always plain; a plain web version only joins the cycle, as a second opinion on a library text that may be the wrong one. The control is a `<button>` that `disabled`s itself back into the passive label it used to be whenever there is nothing to cycle — a single version, or `off` mode, where the library's text is all that may show.

That label carries four things at once — provenance, length, rank (`1/2`) and the synced/plain indicator (`.is-synced`, the accent tint) — so the chevron, not a colour, is what marks it tappable: on this line the accent already means "synced" and cannot also mean "hover". The length is what tells two uploads of one song apart, album names being too long for the chip. While a search runs the chip says so instead, which is why no spinner shares the box with it. Its vertical padding is capped by the row: the switch beside it sets the row's height, and anything taller takes that height off the lyrics box above.

## Enlarged cover

Both lyrics controls share `.np-lyrics-tools`, one pill floating over the box's lower-left corner: the row draws the surface and border, the version chip and retry are segments inside it, parted by a divider that only appears when both show. The row hides itself when neither does, or an empty outline is left over the lyrics. Retry is icon-only — a word beside the chip made the pair read as two objects — and its square padding is what centres the glyph. Retry shows whenever a track is playing and no search is running — an unconvincing text on screen is as good a reason to search again as an empty panel, and with the bar gone this row is the only place left to ask from. It greys out while the server's per-track cooldown would refuse the search.

## Enlarged cover

The card's artwork is a button (`#np-cover-button`) opening `#cover-zoom`, an overlay holding the artwork with the track's title/artist/album over its lower edge. It covers `.left-panel` — the now-playing card only, leaving the stats panel readable — and is a sibling of the card rather than a child, because opening fades out the card's own children and the overlay must not fade with them.

There is no close button: a click anywhere on the overlay closes it, as does Escape, and `render()` closes it when playback stops. Focus never leaves the trigger, which carries `aria-expanded`.

The overlay has no surface of its own — the panel keeps its card background, and the card's content is what clears out under it (`.left-panel.is-zoomed .now-playing > *`, faded by `animateCardContent`). On the stacked layouts the overlay drops its padding so the picture runs edge to edge, the same width as the stats panel under it; `--cover-zoom-radius` keeps the picture's corners on the card's.

`.cover-zoom-figure` is sized as the largest box of the artwork's ratio that fits the panel — `--cover-r` (set from the card image's `naturalWidth/naturalHeight`, already decoded when the view opens, and settled again when the enlarged image loads — on a track change the card's copy still carries the previous artwork's dimensions) plus a `100cqh` width off the overlay's container query. The picture fills that box, upscaled when the panel is bigger than the artwork, and the rounded edge, shadow and caption hug the picture rather than a letterboxed box. On the stacked layouts the card grows with the lyrics far past its own width, so `.left-panel.is-zoomed` squares it off.

The caption (`.cover-zoom-meta`) is a plaque hugging its text near the picture's lower edge, not a band across it: absolutely positioned with `width: fit-content` and auto margins. Its tint and its frosting are two layers, stacked under the text by `z-index`: `.cover-zoom-frost` (a span in the template) carries the `backdrop-filter`, and `::before` carries the tint as a rounded box that its own `filter: blur()` feathers, so the plaque has no outline. They stay apart because an engine may drop a `filter` on an element that also has a `backdrop-filter` — the Android WebView does — which cost the plaque its soft edge when one layer carried both. For the same reason the frosting cannot be feathered by a filter, so a radial-gradient mask fades it out inside the tint: unmasked, it shows as a smeared rectangle wherever the artwork under the plaque is lighter or darker than its surroundings.

`paintProgress` paints the playback position into the bar on the artwork's bottom edge along with the card's own, so the two never drift.

Opening is a FLIP: `animateZoom` measures the card cover's box and the enlarged figure's box at run time — the panel's height follows the lyrics, so neither is fixed — and animates the figure from one to the other while the card's content fades out and the caption arrives late; `animateCard` animates the card's height over the same beat so the stats below slide rather than jump. Closing plays it backwards and only then sets `hidden`. Opening fills backwards only (`zoomOpts`): once it ends the enlarged state comes from the stylesheet rather than an animation holding its last frame. Everything is skipped under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

The card shows a 512px thumbnail; the overlay paints that cached thumbnail first and swaps in the original artwork (the same `/cover/` URL without `?size=`) once it has loaded, so it never shows a blank frame.

## Mosaic and recent-plays pile

The empty-state background mosaic (`loadMosaic`/`layoutMosaic`/`stepMosaic`) and the recent-plays sleeve pile (`loadRecent`/`renderRecent`) are decorative, desktop-driven layouts. They pull cover ids from `/mosaic-covers.json` and `/recent-covers.json`.

The mosaic's belt **steps rather than flows**: one cover every `MOSAIC_STEP_MS`, glided by the tiles' CSS transform transition, and nothing scheduled in between. Continuous motion is what costs — every frame recomposites the whole backdrop, a full core against 2.7% for a still collage — and the cost scales with the step rate, so that constant is the only knob worth turning. A cover only ever glides one slot along its row; anywhere the belt is discontinuous it is placed outright, which stays invisible because those breaks are all off the card.

## Measuring the page

Two traps, both of which quietly yield wrong numbers rather than an error:

- The app's `CSP default-src 'self'` blocks a `<style>` injected at runtime, so a probe that overrides CSS that way measures nothing at all — the override never applies. CSSOM writes (`el.style.foo = …`) and the Web Animations API are unaffected.
- `getBoundingClientRect()` on a mosaic tile returns the bounding box of the 3°-rotated square, ~10px wider than the cover itself. Read the CSS width when the number matters.

## Android bridge

Inside the Android WebView a native object `window.LyrionApp` is injected. The JS detects it (kept in `APP_BRIDGE`), adds `body.in-app`, reveals the header menu button, and wires it to `bridge.openMenu()` / `openSettings()`. Pull-to-refresh is app-only too: a downward drag starting in the card's cover/meta zone (`PULL_ZONE`, so never the scrolling lyrics box) rides the `#np-pull` badge down from the card's top edge and calls `bridge.reload()` past `PULL_TRIGGER`, which reloads through the shell so a server that has gone away lands on the native error view. The gesture only starts with the page and the card both at their top, and the `touchmove` listener is non-passive because suppressing the WebView's overscroll needs `preventDefault()`. On Android, the "open in Lyrion" links become `intent://` URLs targeting the LMS Material app. Guard any app-only behaviour behind the presence of the bridge, as the existing code does.

## Regenerate the screenshots after a visual change

The images (`docs/screenshots/`) are checked in and embedded in the READMEs: the header pair (`dashboard-en.png` in EN, `dashboard-fr.png` in FR, plus `dashboard-app.png`) and the row of thumbnails below it (`demo-*.png` and `dashboard-mobile.png`, shared by both languages). **If your change alters what the dashboard looks like** — layout, styling, colors, the empty state, the lyrics/stats panels, an icon, anything a user would see — regenerate them so the docs don't drift from the app:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt playwright
playwright install chromium        # once
python scripts/generate_screenshots.py
```

The script runs the real app with the Lyrion/DB layers mocked (fake track, synced LRC, generated cover art, canned stats) and captures every image with headless Chromium — desktop in **both** languages, the mobile view, the Android app view, and the demo gallery (enlarged cover, karaoke lyrics, recent-plays pile, statistics panel, empty-state mosaic). Each capture is one `Shot` entry in the script's `SHOTS` map, so a new one is a single declarative line. No Lyrion server or database is needed. Commit the updated PNGs alongside the code change, and keep both language shots in sync (they're regenerated together). Skip this only for changes with no visual effect (pure refactors, endpoint-only tweaks).

## Checklist

1. No new framework/bundler/npm dep; stay vanilla and edit the single JS file.
2. Every user-facing string comes from `I18N` (key added to `i18n.py` FR+EN).
3. Read server data from the existing endpoints / `data-*` attributes.
4. Keep covers same-origin so tinting works.
5. Run `npx --yes eslint@9 static/*.js` — it gates CI.
6. Visual change? Regenerate `docs/screenshots/` (see above) and commit the PNGs.
